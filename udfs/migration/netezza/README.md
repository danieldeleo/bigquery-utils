# Netezza UDFs

This directory contains [user-defined functions](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/user-defined-functions)
which mimic the behavior of proprietary functions in Netezza. Each UDF within this
directory will be automatically synchronized to the `bqutil` project within the
`nz` dataset for reference in queries.
